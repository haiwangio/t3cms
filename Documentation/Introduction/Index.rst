What does it do?
================

This extension brings a new backend module, with that you can set information for the layout and design for each page. You can easy assign the settings to your fluidtemplate and use them.

You can add new options to the settings via TypoScript to create new options for navigations or content, that can choose in your theme settings.

Layout: Containers and sidebars can be set on the theme options, so we are fine when we are using backend-layouts just for controlling the display of columns in the backend.
